# DoubleLinkedList

**DoubleLinkedList** is a C# console application that implements a doubly linked list data structure. It provides functionality to add, remove, and traverse nodes in both forward and reverse directions.

## Features

- ➕ **Add Items:** Add nodes to the front or the end of the list.
- ➖ **Remove Items:** Remove nodes or items from the list efficiently.
- 🔄 **Reverse Nodes:** Reverse the order of nodes in the list.
- 🔍 **Search:** Check if an item exists in the list.
- 📋 **Copy:** Copy the list's contents to an array.
- ♻️ **Enumerate:** Iterate through the list using `foreach`.

## Technologies Used
- **C#** for the implementation of the doubly linked list.
- **.NET Core** for compiling and running the application.

## Prerequisites
-**.NET SDK 8.0** or later

## Future Enhancements
-⚡ Performance Optimization: Optimize the list operations for large datasets.
-📈 Advanced Traversal Methods: Implement more complex traversal and searching algorithms.
